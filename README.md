Is Julian Edelman a great reciever or is he a product of the New England Patriots system?

I have taken NFL Data from 2009-2016 and have filtered it down to every catch Julian Edelman has made during that time frame. I attempt to track Edelman's progress over time and determine if he is, in fact, an elite reciever. Using win probabilities and tracking Edelman's progression over time you can see just how much he impacts the outcome for the Patriots.
